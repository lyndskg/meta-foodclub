ML-Based Restaurant Recommendation System


## Description: 
meta-foodclub is a coding project that leverages machine learning (ML) to generate personalized restaurant, cafe, and bar suggestions for users based on their Yelp and Beli history, metrics, preferences, and popular/good establishments. 

The system takes into account user-rated venues, to-visit lists, preferred cuisines, cost preferences, distance from the user's home, and offers an option to adjust recommendations based on user ratings' correlation with an establishment's Yelp, Google, or Michelin Guide score/rating.

## Key Features:
1. User Profile Analysis: Analyze the user's Yelp and Beli history, ratings, and to-visit list to create a comprehensive user profile.
2. Restaurant Recommendation Engine: Develop an ML-based recommendation engine to suggest relevant establishments based on the user's profile and preferences.
3. Cuisine Preference Recognition: Implement algorithms to recognize the user's preferred cuisines and incorporate them into the recommendation process.
4. Cost and Distance Consideration: Consider the user's preferred cost range and distance from home when suggesting restaurants.
5. Popularity and Quality Metrics: Use popularity metrics and establishment scores/ratings (e.g., Yelp, Google, Michelin Guide) to recommend popular and highly-rated venues.
6. User Feedback Integration: Allow users to provide feedback on recommended establishments to improve future recommendations.
7. User-Adjustable Correlation: Offer an option for users to adjust the importance of their ratings' correlation with establishment scores/ratings in the recommendation algorithm.


## Best Coding Languages:
Python is an excellent choice for this project due to its robust ML libraries, web frameworks, and data processing capabilities. For web-based interaction, Python web frameworks like Flask or Django can be used.


## Basic Workflow:
1. Data Collection: Collect user data from Yelp and Beli, including visited establishments, ratings, and to-visit lists.
2. Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the collected data to create a structured user profile, cuisine preferences, and establishment attributes.
3. ML Recommendation Model: Develop an ML model (e.g., collaborative filtering or content-based filtering) to generate personalized restaurant, cafe, and bar recommendations.
4. Popularity and Quality Metrics: Incorporate popularity metrics and establishment scores/ratings as features in the recommendation model.
5. User Interaction: Create a user-friendly interface where users can view personalized recommendations and adjust correlation preferences.
6. Feedback Mechanism: Implement a feedback mechanism for users to rate the recommended establishments and provide input for future recommendations.


## Basic I/O Details:
meta-foodclub will be accessible through a web-based platform. Users can log in with their Yelp and Beli credentials to allow the system to access their establishment history, ratings, and to-visit lists. The system will then present personalized restaurant, cafe, and bar recommendations on the web interface, along with options to adjust the correlation preferences.


meta-foodclub aims to enhance the dining experience for users by providing tailored and high-quality recommendations based on their individual preferences and ratings. Through the power of ML, users can discover new and delightful dining venues that align with their culinary tastes, making it a go-to platform for food enthusiasts and explorers.
